# Discord_Bot
Learning to make a Discord Bot using Python to retrieve randomized Brookyln 99 quotes,
simulate dice rolls, create channels and obtain weather.

For example here are a couple of the commands:
Running "w.London" will retrieve the temperature, feels like, minimum and maximum temperatures for London.
Running "!roll_dice 2 6" will display the result of two six sided dice rolls.
